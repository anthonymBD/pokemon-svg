 this is not mobile ready just playing around with SVGS also will updated app.js to show pokedex info his type,name,etc
 
 this project is shelved for now I plan to make a full SVG munchlax pokemon evlove into snorlax after you give him 10 berries and have a counter not sure why I want to even do this. I guess to mostly play around with SVG animations and might intergrate Gsap at some point
